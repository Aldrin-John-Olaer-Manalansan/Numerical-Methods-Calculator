[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This shell script operates on [34m[1mCLISP[0m[1m[22m[1] module sets and linking sets:

       +o   [1mcreate[22ms new module sets out of source files

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mcreate[0m
           The command

               $ [1mclisp-link create [4m[22mmodule[24m [4mfile[24m ...

           creates a module set in [4mmodule[24m directory which refers (via symbolic
           links) to files [4mfile[24m... The files are expected to be modules of
           their own.

       [1madd[0m
           The command

               $ [1mclisp-link add [4m[22msource[24m [4mdestination[24m [4mmodule[24m ...

           combines the linking set in directory [4msource[24m and the modules in
           directories [4mmodule[24m... to a new linking set, in the directory
           [4mdestination[24m which is newly created.

       [1mrun[0m
           The command

               $ [1mclisp-link run [4m[22msource[24m [4mmodule[24m ...

           runs the linking set in directory [4msource[24m, with the modules in
           directories [4mmodule[24m... Unless [34m[1mCLISP[0m[1m[22m[1] has been built with the
           configuration option [1m--without-dynamic-modules[22m, the loading will be
           performed using [1mSYS::DYNLOAD-MODULES[22m. Otherwise - this is much
           slower - a temporary linking set will be created and deleted
           afterwards.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       See Section 32.2.6, "Example".
